The paper provides motivational examples of how a single fine-grained or coarse criterion may lead to poor code coverage or fault finding efficiency.

There has been little work, however, in automated goal-based testing, where the goal is a realistic user task, a function, or an abstract behavior. Recent work in human performance regression testing has shown that there is a need for generating multiple test cases that execute the same user task in different ways, however that work does not have an efficient way to generate tests and only a single type of goal has been considered. In this paper we expand the notion of goal based interface testing to generate tests for a variety of goals. We develop a direct test generation technique, EventFlowSlicer, that is more efficient than that used in human performance regression testing, reducing run times by 92.5',\n",

The knowledge about the software under testing is necessary to generate high-quality test cases, but to execute more than 80% of its source code is not an easy task, and demands an in-depth knowledge of the business rules it implements. In this article, we investigate the adequacy, effectiveness, and cost of manually generated test sets versus automatically generated test sets for Java programs. We observed that, in general, manual test sets determine higher statement coverage and mutation score than automatically generated test sets. But one interesting aspect recognized is that the automatically generated test sets are complementary to the manual test set. When we combined manual with automated test sets, the resultant test sets overcame in more that 10%, on average, statement coverage and mutation score when compared to the rates of manual test set, keeping a reasonable cost. Therefore, we advocate that we should concentrate the use of manually generated test sets on testing essential and critical parts of the software.',\n",

However, cutting off the excess parts of a potentially large test case can be a tedious and time-consuming task if performed manually, which has led to the research and development of automated test case reduction techniques. The decade-old Hierarchical Delta Debugging (HDD) algorithm targets structured test inputs, parses them with the help of grammars and applies the minimizing Delta Debugging algorithm to the built trees. We have investigated this algorithm and its implementation, and propose improvements in this paper to address the found shortcomings. We argue that using extended context-free grammars with HDD is beneficial in several ways and the experimental evaluation of our modernized HDD implementation, called Picireny, supports the outlined ideas: the reduced outputs are significantly smaller (by circa 25â\\\\x80\\\\x9340%) on the investigated test cases than those produced by the reference HDD implementation using standard context-free grammars. These results, together with the technical improvements that ease the use of the modernized tool, can hopefully help spreading the adaptation of HDD in practice.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Input/Output Transition Systems (IOTSs) have been widely used as test models in model-based testing. Traditionally, input output conformance testing (IOCO) has been used to generate random test cases from IOTSs. A recent test case generation method for IOTSs, called Complete IOCO, applies fault models to obtain complete test suites with guaranteed fault coverage for IOTSs. This paper measures the efficiency of Complete IOCO in comparison with the traditional IOCO test case generation implemented in the JTorX tool. To this end, we use a case study involving five specification models from the automotive and the railway domains. Faulty mutations of the specifications were produced in order to compare the efficiency of both test generation methods in killing them. The results indicate that Complete IOCO is more efficient in detecting deep faults in large state spaces while IOCO is more efficient in detecting shallow faults in small state spaces.',\n",

Results show that with QF-Test test suites can be created the quickest while EggPlant has the shortest maintenance time. TestComplete performs worse in both disciplines. For test robustness, no clear picture can be drawn. The selection of a test tool is typically done once in a project at the beginning and should be considered carefully.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The growing dependency of our society on increasingly complex software systems, combining mobile and cloud-based applications and services, makes the test activities even more important and challenging. However, sometimes software tests are not properly performed due to tight deadlines, due to the time and skills required to develop and execute the tests or because the developers are too optimistic about possible faults in their own code. Although there are several frameworks for mobile test automation, they usually require programming skills or complex configuration steps. Hence, in this paper, we propose a framework that allows creating and executing tests for Android applications without requiring programming skills. It is possible to create automated tests based on a set of pre-defined actions and it is also possible to inject data into device sensors. An experiment with programmers and non-programmers showed that both can develop and execute tests with a similar time. A real world example using a fall detection application is presented to illustrate the approach.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Reducing the size of tests, typically by delta debugging or a related algorithm, is a critical component of effective automated testing and debugging. Automatically generated or user-submitted tests are often far longer than required, full of unnecessary components that make debugging difficult. Test reduction algorithms automatically remove components of such tests, while preserving the property that the test fails. Unfortunately, reduction can sometimes transform a failing test that detects a subtle, critical, and previously unknown fault into a test that detects a trivial-to-find, unimportant, and already known fault. When reducing a test detecting fault(s) F produces a test that does not detect the same F, this is known as slippage. In the case where an interesting fault slips to an uninteresting fault, slippage is a problem, and must be avoided. However, slippage can also be beneficial, when a long test can be reduced to detect a fault that has not otherwise been detected (including by the original test). While traditional delta debugging only produces one reduced test, the concept of slippage suggests an alternative approach, where the output of reduction is a set of reduced tests, in order to avoid problematic slippage and induce beneficial slippage. In this paper, we present preliminary efforts to understand slippage, and compare two approaches to slippage mitigation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Single-instance multi-tenant SaaS applications allow tenant administrators to (extensively) customize the application according to the requirements of their organizations. In the specific case of workflow-driven applications, the SaaS provider may offer a set of pre-defined workflow activities and leave their composition to the tenant administrators. In such cases, the tenant administrator can instantiate new variants of the application without deploying new software. This effectively makes these tenant administrators part of the DevOps team, and in turn creates the need for the SaaS provider to provide them with Quality Assurance tool support. One such tool is a regression testing framework that allows them to make sure that a new version of a workflow can behave similarly as to a successful execution of a previous version.   This paper highlights the potential and discusses the inherent challenges of running regression tests on workflows in the production environment of a multi-tenant SaaS application and outlines a solution in terms of architecture and automation techniques for mocking and regression detection under control of tenant administrators.',\n",
